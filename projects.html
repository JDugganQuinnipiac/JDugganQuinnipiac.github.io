        <h3>Here are a few GitHub Projects I have created throughout the semester</h3>

        <div class="container">
            <h3 class="header">Calculator</h3>
            <p>In this project I made a very simple calculator that takes 2 numbers from a user, and can give them back the sum, difference, product, or quotient of the numbers.</p>

            <h3 class="header">Animal Picker</h3>
            <p>In this project I made a simple, yet fun, program that allows the user to pick from a list of animals and shows them ASCII art of their choice</p>

        <div class="container">
            <h3 class="header">Vending Machine</h3>
            <p>In this project I made a program that simulates a Vending Machine. The user is given the selection and prices, and has to insert the proper amount of money in order for the transaction to occur.</p>
