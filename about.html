            <p>Hello! My name is Jack Duggan and I am a Junior Computer Science major with a minor in Mathematics at Quinnipiac University. From an early age, I fell in love with technology, especially computers. I would spend a lot of my free time playing around on them and experimenting with different apps and software. It was in highschool when I decided that I want to actually learn about computers, how they work, how to program, etc. So I took a couple of programming classes then I knew this was the career I wanted to enter.
                I have increased my knowledge drastically after having a few years here at Quinnipiac. Taking courses that deal with many aspects of computers such as: programming languages, computer architecture, data structures, etc.</p>
            
            <p>I also have the best Rottweiler a guy could ask for, his name is Tyson. Say Hello!</p>
